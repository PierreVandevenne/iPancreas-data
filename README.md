Public diabetes device data files.

### About

This repository contains, at present, some of my (@jebeck) diabetes device files with my identifying information scrubbed from them. Anyone may use these files for investigating/visualizing/exploring diabetes data generated by a person with type 1 diabetes. I appreciate a link to your investigations/visualizations/explorations if you make something cool with my data, but I do not require this.
